# Operating System Hardening
**Operating System (OS) hardening** is a cybersecuirty exercise where you close the security gaps and other hidden risks that give attackers a vulnerability to exploit. You can significantly decrease the attack surface by reducing the number of loopholes within your operating system.

## 🧠Outcomes from the lab
* Study, implemntation and review of OS hardening techniques.
* Understand the cyber vilnerabilities during remote access, hardening machanisms and implementation in practice.
* Study and implement data backup ploicies in the context of the NIST cyber security framework.

## ✅Tasks To Do:
- [ ] Ubuntu Server
- [ ] Windows 10
*(more OSs will be added later...)*
